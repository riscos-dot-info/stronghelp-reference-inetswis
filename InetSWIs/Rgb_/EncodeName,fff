RGB_EncodeName (&90681)
#Parent RGB_
=>	R0 =	&BBGGRR00 of colour
	R1 =	<flags=>.flags>
	R2 =	pointer to 64 byte block (128 bytes if b0 set)
<=	R0 =	distance of returned colour from that requested, if b0 set
	R1 =	pointer to name, or -1 if could not be matched

This SWI converts a colour number into a colour name. The 'best match' rule uses the same weightings as the ColourTrans module (R=2, G=4, B=1).
