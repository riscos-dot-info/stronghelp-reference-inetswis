RGB_DecodeName  (&90680)
#Parent RGB_
=>	R0 =	pointer to colour name
<=	R1 =	&BBGGRR00 of colour, or -1 if colour could not be found in database

This SWI converts a colour name into a colour number. #rrggbb names will always work, but 'real' names require the database to be present in InetDBase:rgb.
