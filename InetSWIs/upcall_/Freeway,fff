Warns that an object has been added or changed, removed (by the holder), or
deleted (by Freeway).

This call warns controlling applications that the named object has been
added, removed or changed. It is also issued when <Freeway=>Freeway_> has detected that
the information held about a locally held object is unreliable, (as a result
of possible temporary name duplication, for example) and has removed it
unilaterally.  It is issued on callback, and the contents of the supplied
name and descriptor buffers are guaranteed not to change provided they are
read from within the application's UpCall handler.
