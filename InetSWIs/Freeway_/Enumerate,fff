Enumerate objects of a given type.

This SWI allows a controlling application to enumerate currently held
authenticated or unauthenticated objects of a given type, obtaining their
names, location IP addresses, and descriptors if present.  If an
<authentication value=>Freeway_objectauth> is provided then only those objects whose actual
<authentication value=>Freeway_objectauth> matches the supplied value are enumerated. If no
<authentication value=>Freeway_objectauth> is supplied then only unauthenticated objects are
enumerated. The length of the held <object name=>Freeway_objectname> or descriptor may be read
without filling in buffers by setting R3=0 or R5=0 respectively, on entry.
However in this case there is no guarantee that the object attributes will
not have changed, or that the object will still exist, if the SWI is called
again some time later with the same enumeration reference.

If R7 is returned -1 then there were no further known objects of that type 
- the <object name=>Freeway_objectname> buffer will not have been filled in, and R6 is undefined.

An error is returned if the <type number=>Freeway_typenumber> is unknown, or if a supplied name or
descriptor buffer is too short. In the latter cases the actual name and
descriptor lengths are returned in R2 and R4.
