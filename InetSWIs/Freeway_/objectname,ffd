Object name
#wrap on
This is the name of an object.

An object name is unique within the set of objects of the same type within a
site. Object names are terminated by a control character (and will return a
terminator of zero on output), case independent, alphanumeric strings,
created by users or application software. Maximum length is 64 bytes,
including the terminator.
