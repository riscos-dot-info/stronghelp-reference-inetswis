This SWI adds or removes a locally held object of a given type. If the
object is unauthenticated then other computers are notified immediately,
otherwise notification is withheld until a remote computer requests it.  An
error is returned if the type number is not known (i.e. if <Freeway_Register>
has not been called with this type number), or if an object is added and a
remote object of the given name and type already exists, or if an object is
removed and no local object of the given name and type is currently held, or
if no memory exists to store information about the object.

If flags bit 0 is set and the object named is already held as a local object,
the object's descriptor and authentication value are updated if they differ
from those passed to the SWI.

Controlling applications should be prepared to receive
UpCall_Freeway, reason code object deleted, referring to
any object previously added successfully. This is to
cover the possibility of Freeway deciding that the information
held about an object is unreliable and so deciding to remove it
unilaterally, e.g. if a remote object is created with the
same name as a local object.
