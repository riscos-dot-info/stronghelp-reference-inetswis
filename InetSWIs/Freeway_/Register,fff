Register or deregister interest in objects of a given Freeway type.

This SWI enables a controlling application to register interest in
authenticated or unauthenticated objects of a particular Freeway type with
the local Freeway software, and also to give a 'name' to that type (this
name is of no significance to the software, it's just for the convenience of
the human user). Freeway will hold information arriving from the network
about a remote object only if one or more registrations of interest have
been made locally in that object's type.  If the object is authenticated
then at least one of those registrations must have included an
authentication value which matches the object's own. An error is returned
if insufficient free memory exists.
