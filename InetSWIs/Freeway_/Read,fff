This SWI reads information about the attributes of an object. The type number
and object name must be provided. The SWI returns the IP address of the
holder, and optionally the descriptor. The length of a held <object descriptor=>Freeway_objectdesc>
may be read by setting R4 to 0 on entry. However
in this case there is no guarantee that the object attributes will not have
changed, or that the object will still exist, if the SWI is called again some
time later.

An error is returned if the type number is unknown, or the object name is
unknown, or if a supplied authentication value does not match the object's
own authentication value, or if a supplied object descriptor buffer is too
short;  in this case the actual length is returned in R3.
