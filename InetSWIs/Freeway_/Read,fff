Read attributes of an object.

This SWI reads information about the attributes of an object. The type
number and object name must be provided. The SWI returns the IP address of
the holder, and optionally the descriptor. The length of a held <object
descriptor=>Freeway_objectdesc> may be read by setting R4=0 on entry. However in this case there
is no guarantee that the object attributes will not have changed, or that
the object will still exist, if the SWI is called again some time later with
the same <object name=>Freeway_objectname>.  An error is returned if the <type number=>Freeway_typenumber> is unknown,
or the object name is unknown, or if a supplied <authentication value=>Freeway_objectauth> does
not match the object's own authentication value, or if a supplied <object
descriptor=>Freeway_objectdesc> buffer is too short;  in this case the actual length is returned
in R3.
