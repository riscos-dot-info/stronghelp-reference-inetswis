Refresh interval

The Freeway software in each computer will periodically re-notify other
computers about unauthenticated objects which are held by the local machine,
so that they know that the objects continue to be accessible. This permits,
for example,  other machines to know when a computer holding Freeway objects
has been powered down. The  renotification period is called the "refresh
interval", and is determined by the Freeway software and is typically 30
seconds.
