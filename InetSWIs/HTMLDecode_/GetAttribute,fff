HTMLDecode_GetAttrib  (&4D841)
#Parent HTMLDecode_
=>	R0 =	pointer to string of attributes

<=	R0 =	pointer to rest of string; after attribute
	R1 =	capitalised attribute name, or 0 if none left
	R2 =	value of attribute, or 0 if none given

This SWI should be called for tags, after the tag itself has been removed. This should simplify the decoding of HTML attributes.
