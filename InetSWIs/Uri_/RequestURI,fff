URI_RequestURI  (&4E382)
#Parent URI_
=>	R0 =	flags (currently reserved)
	R1 =	pointer to buffer for URI, or 0 to read size
	R2 =	length of buffer
	R3 =	URI handle

\<=	R2 =	offset of terminating null, or size if R1 was 0.

This SWI is used by an application or module to find the size of a the URI or to copy it into it's buffer and accept that it will handle it.

Note: If you cannot handle the size of the buffer returned then there is no way to notify the module that this is the case and thus release memory.
