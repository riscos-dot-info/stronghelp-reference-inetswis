URI_RequestURI  (&4E382)
#Parent URI_
=>	R0 =	flags (currently reserved)
	R1 =	pointer to buffer for URI, or 0 to read size
	R2 =	length of buffer
	R3 =	URI handle

\<=	R2 =	offset of terminating null, or size if R1 was 0.

This SWI is used by an application or module to find the size of the URI or to copy it into it's buffer and accept that it will handle it.

Note: If you cannot handle the size of the buffer returned then there is no way to notify the module that this is the case and thus release memory.
