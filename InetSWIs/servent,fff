Service entry block
The servent block is as defined in unix C.

Offset	Contents
#Line
0	pointer to official name of service
4	pointer to <aliases list=>.aliases> for the service, or 0 if none.
8	port number
12	pointer to name of protocol

Or, in C :
#Indent 2
#Wrap Off;fCode;Tab fCode,fCode
struct servent \{
  char *s_name;		/* Official name of service */
  char **s_aliases;	/* Alternative names for service */
  int  s_port;		/* Port number to use */
  char *s_proto;	/* Protocol to use */
\};
#
#Subpage aliases
Service aliases list
The aliases list consists of a 0-terminated list of pointers to the alias names. The list, like the servent block itself, is not static.
