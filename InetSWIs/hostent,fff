Host entry block
The hostent block is as defined in unix C. The addresses given are in network byte order (the reverse of normal Acorn words).

Offset	Contents
#Line
0	pointer to primary name of host
4	pointer to a block of pointers to alias names for the host
8	address type
12	address length
16	pointer to a list of addresses for host

Or, in C :
#Indent 2
#Wrap Off;fCode;Tab fCode,fCode
struct hostent \{
  char *h_name;	/* Official name of host */
  char **h_aliases;	/* Alternative names for host */
  int  h_addrtype;	/* Host address type */
  int  h_length;	/* Length of each address */
  char **h_addr_list;	/* List of addresses for host */
\#define h_addr h_addr_list[0]	/* Address, for back compatability */
\};

#wrap;f;Indent 0
In BASIC you will usually want to use !!(hostent!16).
