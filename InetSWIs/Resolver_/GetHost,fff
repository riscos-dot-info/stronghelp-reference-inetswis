Resolver_GetHost  (&46001)
#Parent Resolver_
=>	R0 =	pointer to zero-terminated host name
<=	R0 =	pointer to error block if error, <error number=>.errors>
	R1 =	pointer to <hostent> structure if successful, or 0 otherwise

This SWI will either return a host entry if one is cached or begin a lookup if not. This call should be used for multi-tasking lookups. <EINPROGRESS=>InetSocket:EINPROGRESS> will be returned if the lookup is still in progress.
